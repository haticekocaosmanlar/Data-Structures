  # Keep only alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
  cleaned = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())
  # Check if the cleaned string is a palindrome
  return cleaned == cleaned[::-1]

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Let's break it down:
# Cleaning the string:
# Loop through each character in s: O(n)
# char.lower() and char.isalnum() are both O(1)
# Building a new string with ''.join(...): also O(n)
# Reversing and comparing:
# cleaned[::-1] creates a reversed copy → O(n)
# Comparing two strings of length n: O(n)
# So total time: O(n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(n)

# Space Complexity: O(n)
# cleaned holds a new string up to length n
# cleaned[::-1] creates another copy of that string
# So total space:O(n)

# Two pointers solution

      # Move right pointer until it points to an alphanumeric character
      while i < j and not s[j].isalnum():

          return False

      # Move both pointers inward
      i += 1
      j -= 1
  return True

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# n is the length of the input string.
# Each character is visited at most once by either the left or right pointer.
# Even the inner while loops (that skip non-alphanumeric characters) only advance the pointers forward, never backward.
# So in total: linear time, O(n).

# Space Complexity: O(1)
# No additional data structures or copies of the string are created.
# Only a few integer variables (left, right) and temporary chars are used.
# So: constant space, O(1).
